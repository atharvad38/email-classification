Email Classification Project
Project Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model using logistic regression to classify emails as spam or not spam. By leveraging advanced text processing techniques and various machine learning algorithms, the model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and non-spam emails.

Libraries Used
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning, including model building, evaluation, and feature extraction.
Key Features
Text Processing: Utilized TfidfVectorizer to convert raw email text into TF-IDF features, removing English stop words and limiting the features to the top 5000.
Logistic Regression Model: Implemented logistic regression for email classification, a widely used algorithm for binary classification tasks.
Data Splitting: Used train_test_split to divide the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Model Evaluation: Employed metrics such as accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess the logistic regression model's performance.
Results
The logistic regression model demonstrated robust performance in classifying emails, achieving high accuracy and effectively distinguishing between spam and non-spam messages. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided in the project.

Usage
Clone the repository and follow the instructions in the provided Jupyter notebooks to replicate the results and further explore the email classification process using logistic regression.
